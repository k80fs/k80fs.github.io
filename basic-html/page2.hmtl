			<p>There are no authenticated cases of truly melanistic pumas. <em>NB: "Puma" is a euphemism for "panther" here. -KFS</em> <strong>Black pumas</strong> have been reported in Kentucky, one of which had a paler belly. There have also been reports of glossy <strong>black pumas</strong> from Kansas and eastern Nebraska. These are known as the North American Black Panther (NABP). None have ever been photographed or shot in the wild, and none have been bred. There is wide concensus among breeders and biologists that the animal does not exist and is a cryptid. Sightings are current attributed to mistaken species identification by non feline experts, and memetic exaggeration of size.</p>
